# Text Input Script

To take the typing speed test and other tests, <br/>
simply enter text into the input field within the code itself ```text```,
hover and click the cursor over the entry, and wait 10 seconds <br/>
(the time can be changed using ```delay_before_start = 10```).

Before use install ```pip install pyautogui```
